                            <b>Description:</b> During my 12 week internship, I developed and deployed a centralized external authorization provider,
                            streamlining user access management for services within Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC). The authorization provider
                            leverages the OAuth 2.0 framework and employs JWT validation for Bearer tokens, ensuring robust and secure access control. 
                            With this new authorization provider, developers of ACC services are able to seamlessly expose their APIs to all Autodesk users, 
                            significantly expanding the reach and user base of their services. Additionally, with all service requests routed through
                            the authorization provider, performance is optimized through public key caching in order to reduce overhead from upstream requests.

                        <p>Jan 2024 - Apr 2024 | Remote</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Description:</b> With thousands of tests run during the triaging period, analyzing individual failed tests becomes a time-consuming and resource intensive task. 
                            The reason for failure may be due to issues with the build and not with the test cases themselves, in which case, engineers would manually re-run the individual tests again
                            to figure out the cause of failure. The automated retry mechanism reduces the manual efforts of engineers and accelerates the triaging process by 
                            automatically running a test again if it meets a particular threshold of errors and/or failures. Throughout my internship with Splunk, I implemented this 
                            automated retry mechanism as a script and integrated it with Splunk's internal testing pipelines.

                            alongside 6 other students to design and implement a full-stack security application that continuously monitors and flags any non-compliant (and potentially malicious) activity within the company's 
                            internal systems. The system is extensible, as security engineers are able to add more scripts to the system to check for new security policies. Additionally, the system is 
                            integrated with Slack so security engineers can be notified whenever a flag is raised. With this application, many manual workflows are reduced, allowing security engineers to 
                            focus on greater security priorities as the company continues to grow.

                            metrics regarding PNC's transactional processing procedures. I orchestrated data pipelines to continuously
                            persist metrics data from distributed data stores to a centralized database, based on queries submitted by a business analyst. 
                            By having the metrics persist to a centralized database, the data could then be consumed in a variety of ways,
                            which include viewing the data from a user interface or other platforms like Tableau. Ultimately, analysts would be able to view metrics
                            data in a more streamlined way, allowing them to discover insights more easily and effectively.

                                    <p>
                                        As a member of the project team, I developed features to enhance the CARLA driving simulator for human factors research on 
                                        driver workload, driver distraction, and driver interfaces for partially automated vehicles. For instance, I worked on
                                        doubling the efficiency of conducting experiments on the simulator by combining two different
                                        driving scenarios (intersection and freeway),  which were originally developed on separate interfaces, into a single
                                        backend infrastructure. Additionally, I designed realistic virtual worlds to test different driving scenarios for the 
                                        simulator, developing proficiency in computer aided design and various application software.

                                    <p>
                                        As a leader of the project team, I made sure that the team engaged in productive weekly meetings and that the team's progress
                                        aligned with our long-term project roadmap. With around 30 members in our team, I strived to create an inclusive and stress-free 
                                        environment by encouraging open discussions and by hosting game nights to foster team bonding. Additionally, I created a project 
                                        management spreadsheet to help our team keep track of their progress in order to meet key milestones and objectives. These initiatives
                                        helped to make our team meetings effective, allowing our team to make significant advancements to the driving simulator.

                                        A scalable search engine like Google! While working on this application, I learned retrieval concepts such as text analysis (tf-idf) 
                                        and link analysis (PageRank), and I practiced parallel data processing with MapReduce. Using Hadoop and a pipeline of MapReduce programs 
                                        written in Python, I created a segmented inverted index of web pages. Additionally, I created index servers, which are REST APIs for each 
                                        inverted index segment, integrating in PageRank scores to output a list of hits based on the user's queries. Finally, I developed an end-to-end 
                                        application consisting of an interface for users to search, a server that makes REST API requests to each index server, and a database that stores
                                        information about the web pages. Combining all these parts, I developed a fully functional and scalable search engine application that allows
                                        users to find any web page on the internet.

                                        I implemented my very own thread library! This library provides a robust framework for thread creation 
                                        and management, including scheduling, context switching, and termination, as well as synchronization
                                        mechanisms, including mutexes and condition variables. In addition, this thread library supports multi-processor
                                        systems to leverage parallelism and increased performance. Some of the challenges that occurred while working on 
                                        this project were balancing performance and fairness in thread scheduling, managing resources with thread control
                                        blocks during context switches, avoiding deadlock situations, and handling external thread control events such as 
                                        interrupts. Through this project, I was able to consider many different design decisions and ultimately build

                                        A multithreaded, secure network file system! Clients send network messages to the file server, which consist of file system
                                        operations like create, delete, read, and write. The file server provides a hierarchical system of files and directories,
                                        which are described by inodes and stored on disk blocks. In order to implement a robust file system, I ensured crash 
                                        consistency by atomically updating the file system and maintaining a certain order of disk writes. In addition, I utilized
                                        hand-over-hand locking when traversing through file system objects in order to effectively control access to shared resources

                                        that manages application processes' virtual address spaces. Application processes communicate with the kernel
                                        via system calls and page faults to manipulate its address space. The kernel then provides address space abstraction 
                                        to application processes by reading and writing physical memory, page tables, swap space, and files. In order to 
                                        optimize performance and minimize thrashing, I employed techniques such as write-back caching, the clock algorithm
                                        (an approximation of LRU) for page eviction, and eager swap reservation. Through this project, I learned how to 
                                        plan out effective data structures to store relevant information about each page (dirty page, resident page, etc.), 
                                        as well as how to manipulate protection bits of page table entries to reflect the different states a page can be in.
