                <p>
                    I'm an aspiring software engineer from NYC, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in computer science at the University of Michigan. 
                    Within tech, I'm interested in data science, machine learning/ AI, and full stack application development. Through numerous software 
                    engineering project experiences, I am actively cultivating and expanding my skillset to enhance my proficiency within these fields. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have interned at various companies including <a class= "about-links" href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, <a class= "about-links" href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">Riot Games</a>, 
                    and <a class= "about-links" href="https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.html">PNC Financial Services</a>. Additionally, I lead the CARLA Driving Simulator project team
                    at the University of Michigan and I am a peer advisor under the <a class= "about-links" href="https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/">Multidisciplinary Design Program</a>. In the past year, I 
                    also developed an interest in attending hackathons; I love collaboration and the excitement of building a product from scratch and seeing ideas come to life! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you could find me dancing (check out my dance team, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kmotion_/">K-Motion</a>), working out at the gym, or doing a variety of arts and crafts.
                    I love painting and bullet journaling, and I recently started making polymer clay figurines.

                            <b>Description:</b> With thousands of tests run during the triaging period, analyzing individual failed tests becomes a time-consuming and resource intensive task. 
                            The reason for failure may be due to issues with the build and not with the test cases themselves, in which case, engineers would manually re-run the individual tests again
                            to figure out the cause of failure. The automated retry mechanism reduces the manual efforts of engineers and accelerates the triaging process by 
                            automatically running a test again if it meets a particular threshold of errors and/or failures. Throughout my internship with Splunk, I implemented this 
                            automated retry mechanism as a script and integrated it with Splunk's internal testing pipelines.

                            alongside 6 other students to design and implement a full-stack security application that continuously monitors and flags any non-compliant (and potentially malicious) activity within the company's 
                            internal systems. The system is extensible, as security engineers are able to add more scripts to the system to check for new security policies. Additionally, the system is 
                            integrated with Slack so security engineers can be notified whenever a flag is raised. With this application, many manual workflows are reduced, allowing security engineers to 
                            focus on greater security priorities as the company continues to grow.

                            persist metrics data from distributed data stores to a centralized database, based on queries submitted by a business analyst. 
                            By having the metrics persist to a centralized database, the data could then be consumed in a variety of ways,
                            which include viewing the data from a user interface or other platforms like Tableau. Ultimately, analysts would be able to view metrics
                            data in a more streamlined way, allowing them to discover insights more easily and effectively.

                            <p>
                              As a member of the project team, I developed features to enhance the CARLA driving simulator for human factors research on 
                              driver workload, driver distraction, and driver interfaces for partially automated vehicles. For instance, I worked on
                              doubling the efficiency of conducting experiments on the simulator by combining two different
                              driving scenarios (intersection and freeway),  which were originally developed on separate interfaces, into a single
                              backend infrastructure. Additionally, I designed realistic virtual worlds to test different driving scenarios for the 
                              simulator, developing proficiency in computer aided design and various application software. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              As a leader of the project team, I made sure that the team engaged in productive weekly meetings and that the team's progress
                              aligned with our long-term project roadmap. With around 30 members in our team, I strived to create an inclusive and stress-free 
                              environment by encouraging open discussions and by hosting game nights to foster team bonding. Additionally, I created a project 
                              management spreadsheet to help our team keep track of their progress in order to meet key milestones and objectives. These initiatives
                              helped to make our team meetings effective, allowing our team to make significant advancements to the driving simulator.
