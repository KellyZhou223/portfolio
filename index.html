                <p>
                    I'm an aspiring software engineer from NYC, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in computer science at the University of Michigan. 
                    Within tech, I'm interested in data science, machine learning/ AI, and full stack application development. Through numerous software 
                    engineering project experiences, I am actively cultivating and expanding my skillset to enhance my proficiency within these fields. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have interned at various companies including <a class= "about-links" href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, <a class= "about-links" href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">Riot Games</a>, 
                    and <a class= "about-links" href="https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.html">PNC Financial Services</a>. Additionally, I lead the CARLA Driving Simulator project team
                    at the University of Michigan and I am a peer advisor under the <a class= "about-links" href="https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/">Multidisciplinary Design Program</a>. In the past year, I 
                    also developed an interest in attending hackathons; I love collaboration and the excitement of building a product from scratch and seeing ideas come to life!

                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you could find me dancing (check out my dance team, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kmotion_/">K-Motion</a>), working out at the gym, or doing a variety of arts and crafts.
                    I love painting and bullet journaling, and I recently started making polymer clay figurines.

                            <b>Description:</b> With thousands of tests run during the triaging period, analyzing individual failed tests becomes a time-consuming and resource intensive task. 
                            The reason for failure may be due to issues with the build and not with the test cases themselves, in which case, engineers would manually re-run the individual tests again. 
                            The automated retry mechanism reduces the manual efforts of engineers and accelerates the triaging process by automatically running a test again if it meets a particular 
                            threshold of errors and/or failures. Throughout my internship with Splunk, I implemented this automated retry mechanism as a script and integrated it with Splunk's internal
                            testing pipelines.

                            <b>Description:</b> Over the course of 10 weeks, I worked on implementing a system that continuously monitors for functional
                            metrics regarding PNC's transactional processing procedures. I orchestrated data pipelines to continuously
                            persist metrics data from distributed data stores to a centralized database, based on queries submitted by a business analyst. 
                            By having the metrics persist to a centralized database, the data could then be consumed in a variety of ways,
                            which include viewing the data from a user interface or other platforms like Tableau. Ultimately, analysts would be able to view metrics
                            data in a more streamlined way, allowing them to discover insights more easily and effectively.
